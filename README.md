# RestrictionDigest
A powerful Perl module for simulating the genome digestions

DESCRIPTION

RestrictionDigest can simulate the reference genome digestion and
generate comprehensive information of the simulation. It can simulate single-enzyme
digestion, double-enzyme digestion and size selection process. It can also analyze
multiple genomes at one run and generates concise comparison of enzyme(s) performance
across the genomes.
