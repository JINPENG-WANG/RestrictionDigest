Revision history for RestrictionDigest

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

20150903        Fix a bug. To make it process standard FASTA file correctly. Standard FASTA file contains newline characters within
                one sequence.
20160829        Update the RestrictionDigest::SingleItem::Single and RestrictionDigest::MultipleItems::Single to make them support 
                the digestion with enzyme FspEI whose recognition site is CCNNNNNNNNNNNN|NNNNN. But as the enzyme's recognition site 
                containes a lot of 'N's, it runs slowly.
